spk_01: Hey Mark, have you got any plans for the weekend?
spk_02: Not really. I was thinking of just staying home and catching up on some sleep. Why?
spk_01: Oh come on! It’s been ages since we went anywhere. How about a quick road trip to the mountains? The weather’s supposed to be perfect.
spk_02: Hmm, that does sound tempting. But do you think we can manage it with such short notice? Hotels might be full already.
spk_01: Don’t worry, I checked this morning — there are still a few cozy cabins available. We could leave early Saturday and be back by Sunday night.
spk_02: That actually sounds great. Alright, count me in. I’ll bring snacks and music for the drive!
