spk_01: remark. Have you got any
spk_02: Not really. I was thinking of just staying home and catching up on some sleep.
spk_01: Oh come on It's been ages since we went anywhere How about a quick road trip to the mainland
spk_01: The weather's supposed to be perfect.
spk_01: That does sound tempting, but do you think we can manage it with such short notice? Hotels might be full already. Don't worry, I checked this morning. There are still a few cozy cabins available. We could leave early Saturday and be back by Sunday night.
spk_02: This actually sounds great. Alright, count me in. I'll bring snacks and music for the drive.
