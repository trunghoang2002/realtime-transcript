remark. Have you got any Not really. I was thinking of just staying home and catching up on some sleep. Oh come on It's been ages since we went anywhere How about a quick road trip to the mainland The weather's supposed to be perfect. That does sound tempting, but do you think we can manage it with such short notice? Hotels might be full already. Don't worry, I checked this morning. There are still a few cozy cabins available. We could leave early Saturday and be back by Sunday night. This actually sounds great. Alright, count me in. I'll bring snacks and music for the drive.
