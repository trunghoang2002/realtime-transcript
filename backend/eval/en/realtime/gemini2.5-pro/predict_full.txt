Hey Mark, have you got any plans for the weekend? Really, I was thinking of just staying home and catching up on some sleep. Come on. It's been ages since you went anywhere. How about a quick road trip to the Netherlands? that are supposed to be perfect. That does sound tempting, but do you think we can manage it with such short notice? Hotels might be full Don't worry. I checked this morning. There are still a few cozy cabins available. We could leave early Saturday and be back by Sunday night. That actually sounds great. All right. Count me in. I'll bring snacks and music for the drive.
