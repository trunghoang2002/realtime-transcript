spk_01: Hey Mark, have you got any plans for the weekend?
spk_02: Not really, I was thinking of just staying home and catching up on some sleep. Oh come on.
spk_01: it's been ages since we went anywhere how about a quick road trip to the mountains the weather's supposed to be perfect
spk_02: does sound tempting but do you think we can manage it with such short notice hotels might be full already
spk_01: Don't worry, I checked this morning. There are still a few cozy cabins available.
spk_02: early saturdayand be back by sundaynight
