spk_01: Hey Mark, have you got any plans for the weekend?
spk_02: Not really I was thinking of just staying home and catching up on some sleep.
spk_01: Oh, come on!
spk_01: it's been ages since we went anywhere how about a quick road trip to the mountains the weather's supposed to be perfect
spk_02: 'that does sound tempting but do you think we can manage it with such short notice hotels might be full already.'
spk_01: Don't worry I checked this morning there are still a few cozy cabins available. we could leave early saturday and be back by sunday night
spk_02: 'that actually sounds great all right count me in i'll bring snacks and music for the drive.'
