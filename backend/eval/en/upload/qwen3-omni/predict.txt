spk_01: Hey Mark, have you got any plans for the weekend?
spk_02: Not really. I was thinking of just staying home and catching up on some sleep.
spk_01: Oh, come on. It's been ages since we went anywhere. How about a quick road trip to the mountains?
spk_01: The weather's supposed to be perfect.
spk_02: That does sound tempting, but do you think we can manage it with such short notice Hotels might be full already.
spk_01: Don't worry, I checked this morning. There are still a few cozy cabins available. We could leave early Saturday and be back by Sunday night.
spk_02: That actually sounds great. Alright, count me in. I'll bring snacks and music for the drive.
