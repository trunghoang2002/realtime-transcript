spk_01: hey mark have you got any plans for the weekend
spk_02: not really i was thinking of just staying home and catching up on some sleep oh come on
spk_01: it's been ages since we went anywhere how about a quick road trip to the mountains the weather's supposed to be perfect
spk_02: that does sound tempting but do you think we can manage it with such short notice hotels might be full already
spk_01: don't worry i checked this morning there are still a few cozy cabins available we could leave early saturday and be back by sunday night
spk_02: that actually sounds great all right count me in i'll bring snacks and music for the drive
