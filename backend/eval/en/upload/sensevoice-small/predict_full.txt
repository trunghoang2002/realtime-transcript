hey mark have you got any plans for the weekend not really i was thinking of just staying home and catching up on some sleep oh come on it's been ages since we went anywhere how about a quick road trip to the mountains the weather's supposed to be perfect that does sound tempting but do you think we can manage it with such short notice hotels might be full already don't worry i checked this morning there are still a few cozy cabins available we could leave early saturday and be back by sunday night that actually sounds great all right count me in i'll bring snacks and music for the drive
